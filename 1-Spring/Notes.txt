When we used to spring ORM and we must write the data source configuration again...
This data source configuration discount not good right? Because we never know this property is not changes and
you know we have to change this code in the Java files but it's not a good practice looking hard coding this configuration properties.
We should never hard code this configuration properties.


we should know....
JPa need this local container manager factory Bean transaction manager bean so,
I can see a lot of new manual configuration for each spring projects.

we should know if I'm using spring MVC I should register OK this dispatcherservlet and we should load this.
Dispatches several construct up and we need to map every you know incoming URLs to the servlet

These are painful activities while working I'm saying spring is very great framework, no doubt on that.
But if you want to get that greatness you need to do that, you know.
This activities


Developers again need to spend their time in these three layers...
1)Repository
2)Service
3)Web

Spring boot will provide you ready configuration like I'm saying guys spring boot is nothing but.
It's the only configuration tool.
There is no any difference between spring and spring boot.
While using spring as a developer, we need to write,
you know some configuration to consume those projects. OK in your applications.

spring boot working 90 percentage. I can say automates on your configuration.
Maybe 10 percentage. OK, you need to feed your own configurations.
