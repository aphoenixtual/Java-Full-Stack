Inside that web package writing one controller...
To process the incoming request.
I usually create some payload objects... means how I'm going to accept my request and
how I'm going to give the response.
This is something called payload or model objects. Sometimes people will call them as it DTO.

So my intention with every transfer you know a request comes with three parameters


So when I deployed this particular application saying to my Tomcat by default this web application
initialize this ...
On startup
So first we created the spring application context object. So we have so many logs here.
Then using that context object, OK, we created our dispatcherservlet so henceforth OK if any request not coming...
The dispatcher servlet uses the respective handler mapping.
Configurations.
Means one of the controller will be used to transfer that request

While Using Spring Projects, Complexities

=> Fingding right dependency ( .jar)
=> Lot of manual configuration for each spring-project
