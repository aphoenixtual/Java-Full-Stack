 why we are using Spring Framework ???

The thing is, your dependent object implementation class should not create dependency instance.
So that is the dependency inversion principle, and for that OK, we are using the Spring Framework

what is  java based configurations ???
Java Based configuration means see in the Java file we are making our beans and
 we are injecting their beans. So this is what I'm representing. Java based configurations.
 Of course this is also backed by annotations.
