Spring boot internally uses...
One of the spring four annotation called @ConditionalOn
if that condition is true...
then it includes the configuration.


There are so many ways to create the spring boot applications...

1)So from the spring initializer website you can fill this form then
you can create the springboot project this is way one

2)If you're a eclipse developer.
  you can install the spring plugin
  it's called STS Spring tool set. Or you can download the STS itself.

3)In IntelliJ itself


Did you see ConditionalOn property? So springboot somewhere no saw this property is present spring dot AOP dot auto equal to true.
So because of this property spring boot up like this. AOP configuration automatically
for us AOP configuration automatically know applied while creating this context. That's why it is called autoconfiguration.


behind the scenes so spring is using Hikari. Hikari means it's a connection pool.
