Spring boot internally uses...
One of the spring four annotation called @ConditionalOn
if that condition is true, abating if the condition is true.
then it includes the configuration.


There are so many ways to create the spring boot applications...

1)So from the spring initializer website you can fill this form then
you can create the springboard project this is way one

2)If you're a eclipse developer.
  you can install the spring plugin
  it's called SDS Spring tool set. Or you can download the STS itself.

3)In IntelliJ itself


Did you see conditional on property? So springboard somewhere no saw this property is present spring dot AOP dot auto equal to true.
So because of this property and spring, you know applied. I mean spring boot up like this. AOP configuration automatically
for us AOP configuration automatically know applied while creating this context. That's why it is called auto configuration.


behind the scenes so spring is using Hikari. Hikari means it's a connection pool.
